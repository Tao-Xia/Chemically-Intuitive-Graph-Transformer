# Chemically Intuitive Graph Transformer Based on Valence Bond Theory
This repository contains the official implementation of a Chemically Intuitive Graph Transformer (CIGT) designed to predict the Valence Bond (VB) structure weights and select important VB structures. These structures can then be used to construct a compact wavefunction in Xiamen Valence Bond (XMVB) program, compared to a full structure calculation.

For detailed information on VB theory and XMVB, please refer to [XMVB Documentation](https://xacs.xmu.edu.cn/docs/xmvb/)

> This implement is based on GraphGPS [Rampasek et al., 2022.](https://github.com/rampasek/GraphGPS)

## Usage
1. Predicting Weight for each specific VB structure
```python
# 1. Provide the molecule and geometry. Hereâ€™s an example of a molecule's geometry:
molecule = """

"""     
# 2. Provide the spin multiplicity and active space, e.g.
numl = 1 
nao = 6
nae = 6
# 3. Define the active orbitals, e.g.
# active_orbital =  [5,6,4,2,1,3]
# Each number represents the atom from which the corresponding orbital originates.
# 4. Define the set of VB structures (This functionality is currently supported only when used in conjunction with XMVB, more detailed information please refer to XMVB manual)
# ('COV', '0-1', '0-2', '0-3', ...,'FULL')
# Users can also write the VB structure by yourself.
# The format is the same as the $Str section in XMVB input file, but only the pairing of active orbitals are needed to provide.
```
After defining the molecule, active space and structure set, you can run the following command to predict the VB structure weights
```
python main.py --cfg configs/predict/predict_weight.yaml
```
or run the following command to get the important VB structures that can be used to construct a compact VB wavefunction
```
python main.py --cfg configs/predict/select_structure.yaml
```
