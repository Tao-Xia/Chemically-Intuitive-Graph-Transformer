# Chemically Intuitive Graph Transformer Based on Valence Bond Theory
This is the official implement of chemically intuitive graph transformer to predict the valence bond(vb) structure weight and select the important vb structures to construct compact wavefunction within chemical accuracy compared to full structure calculation.
> This implement is based on GraphGPS [Rampasek et al., 2022.](https://github.com/rampasek/GraphGPS)

```python
import torch
